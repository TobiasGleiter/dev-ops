This means that the:

- First iteration defines the following operations
- Permanent monitoring of the process
- Process enhances finetuning
- Pain-Points can directly adjusted

## Why DevOps?

The process of the software development going faster than ever. In 1970 developing a software projected needed one to five years and cost about 1M $ to 100M $. Today software projects are developed in two to twelve weeks and cost about 10k $ to 1M $.
This fast development reduces the risk of losing the complete business because if the feature does not work it does not cost as much as a one to five year development. Besides that the shorter Software Development Lifecycle decreases that one employee know things that others can't compansate.

## Best Practive DevOps

**DevOps does:**

- increase a culture of working togther

- play a role in the mdoern Software Development (SD)

**Key Performance Indicators (KPI) are:**

Faster Results

- Frequency of the development
- Size of the changes
- Lead time

Quality:

- Mean time to recover
- Development failure rates
- Availablity

Efficiency and Stability:

- Application Performance
- Application Usage

Culture:

- Moral of the employees
- Retention rates

## Cross-functional Teams

Teams in DevOps include all necessary roles. Roles are the Product Manager (PM), Developer (Dev), Operator (Ops). Teams are structures vertically.
