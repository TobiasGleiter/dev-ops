This means that the:

- First iteration defines the following operations
- Permanent monitoring of the process
- Process enhances finetuning
- Pain-Points can directly adjusted

## Why DevOps?

The process of the software development going faster than ever. In 1970 developing a software projected needed one to five years and cost about 1M $ to 100M $. Today software projects are developed in two to twelve weeks and cost about 10k $ to 1M $.
This fast development reduces the risk of losing the complete business because if the feature does not work it does not cost as much as a one to five year development.
